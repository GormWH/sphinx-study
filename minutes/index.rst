Sphinx Book Study Log
=======================================

How I started "Sphinx"
=======================================

**Documentation** is almost always necessary.
I write comments inbetween codes, but I always feel a "REEDME" file is needed(for others and myself too).

I used "LaTeX" for my graduation thesis(twice!), and I know how powerful it is when generating clean, well designed and formal text.
But, it's time consuming, heavy and complicated.

On the other hand, "Markdown"(MD) is super simple.
Write text with indents, \*, #, - then I get a somewhat structured text.
In terms of simplicity, MD is deffidently a good option but it lacks expressions.

A few days ago, I somehow came across "Sphinx", a documentation tool like "LaTeX" and "Markdown".
And I found out that "Sphinx" is much more simple then LaTeX but a little bit more complex then Markdown.
Not too difficalt, but can generate a better text compared to Markdown.
So, decided to study "Sphinx".

I never "studied" a text generating tool before.
I googled for the slightest pieces of knowledge for documentation, and concentrated on programming.
But since I just started a career as a developer, I thought studying one(or more) documentation tool would be useful for a long time.
And that's how I got my eye on "Sphinx".

About the Book - "Sphinxをはじめよう"
===========================================

I bought a Japanese book for Sphinx, because I'm living in Japan.
The author of this book, is one of the developer's of Sphinx.
And that fact gave me trust in this book.
